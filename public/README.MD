# phase-2-project  -  The Eras of Bodybuilding

to run the json server: `json-server --watch db.json`

to run the react app: `npm start`
## Introduction
The Phase 2 Project is my attempt React App to utilize client-side routing with a json-server, and multiple components to better organize my code. 

## Project Description
My Routes are organized inside of my App component and the NavBar is imported into App. I have included 5 client-side routes, allowing users to access the pages using the NavBar. 

I have separated the NavBar Component as well as the AddForm Component in order to keep the code organized and separated into readable lines of code. Each page represented in the NavBar has a separate component to ensure the contents stay distinct. 

Each page represents an era of bodybuilding and it's most memorable bodybuiders of that time.  
The form found on the Home page allows the user to add a bodybuilder of their choosing to any of the eras. It is then logged and displayed into the corresponding page.
